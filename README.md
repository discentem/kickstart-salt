## What is kickstart-salt.py?

`kickstart-salt.py` is a fancy wrapper around [bootstrap-salt.sh](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap/blob/stable/bootstrap-salt.sh) and [bootstrap-salt.ps1](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap/blob/stable/bootstrap-salt.ps1) for bootstrapping Salt minions (Centos and Windows Server) and masters (Centos).

### High Level Overview
`kickstart-salt.py` will perform the following tasks on Centos and Windows Server, with arguments retrieved from [Google Compute Engine Instance metadata](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata):

1. Sets up DNS servers in `/etc/resolv.conf` or via `Set-DnsClientServerAddress`
2. Optionally creates an [`autosign_file`](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html#autosign-file) if bootstrapping a salt master
3. Optionally installs any list of yum packages on the Salt Master
    * This functionally was included particularly to install `git` and `python-pygit2`, which are prerequisites for [gitfs](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/gitfs.html) on the Salt Master.
    * Even if you specify a list of yum packages while bootstrapping a minion, the packages will not be installed. This functionally is restricted to only run on the Salt Master. If you need to install packages on a salt minion, use salt ;P
4. Downloads upstream bootstrap-salt script
    * The url is configurable so you can pin to a specific version of the upstream bootstrap script or host it internally for additional security.
5. Verifies the md5 or sha256 hash of the upstream bootstrap-salt script.
6. Parses bootstrap-salt arguments, provided as json, into the normal cli flags expected by the upstream bootstrap-salt script. Any argument/parameter that is valid for the upstream script can be passed via `kickstart-salt.py` as a key/value pair. See the Usage section for more details.

#### Building a binary with pyinstaller
We can use Pyinstaller to produce a portable binary of kickstart-salt.py. With a binary, you don't have to install the python dependencies on each minion and master.

```
/usr/local/bin/pyinstaller /path/to/kickstart-salt.py --onefile
```

### Python dependencies
You'll need to install these dependencies to run or build a functioning copy of kickstart-salt.py. If you intend to build a binary of the script, you only need to install these dependencies on the build machine. If you forgo building a binary, you'll need to install these dependencies on every machine you run kickstart-salt.py on (i.e. every salt minion and salt master)
```bash
yum install python36 -y
python36 -m ensurepip
python36 -m pip install requests
python36 -m pip install pyyaml
python36 -m pip install deep_merge
```

### Usage Guide (Google Compute Engine)

To bootstrap a new Compute Engine VM with kickstart-salt, you just need to provide a few Google Compute Engine metadata keys: `startup-script`, `dns`, and `kickstart_salt_args`.

##### startup-script

`startup-script` is a GCE metadata key documented by Google. You can read more about it here: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript. `startup-script` can be defined at either the instance or project level. The instance level will take precedence.

In the startup-script metadata key, you need to provide a script which downloads and runs kickstart-salt. Here's an example utilizing nexus:

Note: this example assumes you aren't building a binary with PyInstaller. Also contains invalid url for demo purposes. Modify your script to point at a valid url containing the raw file.
```bash
yum install python36 -y
python36 -m ensurepip
python36 -m pip install requests
python36 -m pip install pyyaml
python36 -m pip install deep_merge

curl -k "https://sourcecontrol.co.org/path/to/raw/python/file/kickstart-salt.py" > /tmp/kickstart-salt.py
sudo /usr/bin/python36 /tmp/kickstart-salt.py
```

##### dns

kickstart-salt expects `dns` to exist as a _project metadata key_ or a _instance metadata key_. If it exists in both places, _instance metadata_ will override and take precedence. `dns` should be a valid JSON dictionary with a key called `entries` who's value is a list of (dns) entries. Here's an example of a `dns` JSON blob:

```JSON
{
  "dns": {
    "entries": [
      "127.0.0.1",
      "127.0.0.2"
    ]
  }
}
```

##### kickstart_salt_args

The final key that kickstart-salt expects is `kickstart_salt_args`, a JSON dictionary. kickstart-salt will deep merge this key's dictionary from project metadata and instance metadata. If a particular key/val exists in both places, instance metadata will take precedence. See https://github.com/halfak/deep_merge for more information on deep merging.

kickstart-salt expects this merged dictionary to have the following keys and values:

<br />

- `bootstrap_salt_expected_hash` *(string), (required)*: sha256 or md5 hash of bootstrap-salt.sh. Type should match `bootstrap_salt_hash_type`.

<br />

- `bootstrap_salt_json_args` *(dictionary), (required)*: keys and values that you would normally provide to bootstrap-salt.sh on the CLI. Any and all arguments that are valid for bootstrap-salt.sh are valid here. See https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap#bootstrapping-salt) for all of the available arguments. Most arguments are simply passed through to bootstrap-salt.sh without modification from `bootstrap_salt_json_args`, however there are some exceptions:

   If a parameter normally wouldn't have a value, such as `-M`, simply set the value to be an empty string. This is necessary because JSON does not accept keys without values.

   For the other exceptions, check out the code for the `process_bootstrap_salt_json_args` function in kickstart-salt.py.

   Here is an example of `bootstrap_salt_json_args`:

   ```JSON
   {
     "bootstrap_salt_json_args": {
        "stable": "2018.3.2",
        "-M": "",
        "-j": {
          "master": "localhost",
          "grains": {
          }
        }
     }
   }
   ```

<br />

- `bootstrap_salt_hash_type` *(string), (optional)*: must be either `"sha256"` or `"md5"`. Defaults to `"sha256"` if not provided.

<br />

- `salt_master_prerequisite_yum_packages` *(list), (optional)*: list of packages to install before installing salt-master.

<br /><br />

- `bootstrap_salt_save_path_Linux` *(string), (optional)*: full path to the location you want to save bootstrap-salt.sh on Linux hosts. This only applies if `platform.system()` evaluates to `Linux`. If `bootstrap_salt_save_path_Linux` is not defined, bootstrap-salt.sh will be saved at the path defined by the `bootstrap_salt_save_path` key.

<br />

- `bootstrap_salt_save_path_Windows` *(string), (optional)*: full path to the location you want to save bootstrap-salt.sh on Windows hosts. This only applies if `platform.system()` evaluates to `Windows`. If `bootstrap_salt_save_path_Windows` is not defined, bootstrap-salt.ps1 will be saved at the path defined by the `bootstrap_salt_save_path` key.

<br />

- `bootstrap_salt_save_path` *(string), (optional)*: full path to the location you want to save bootstrap-salt.sh or bootstrap-salt.ps1 on the VM. This path is only used if neither `bootstrap_salt_save_path_Linux` nor `bootstrap_salt_save_path_Windows` are defined. If this key itself is not defined, it will default to `c:\bootstrap-salt.ps1` on Windows and `/tmp/bootstrap-salt.sh` on Linux.

<br /><br />

- `/etc/salt/master.d/` *(dictionary), (optional)*: each key in this dictionary represents a file that will be created on-disk inside `/etc/salt/master.d/`. You can have as many keys as you like and you can name each key whatever you want.

  Example `/etc/salt/master.d` keys:
  - `blahblah.conf` *(dictionary)*: the keys and values in this dictionary must simply be valid master config data. Consult https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html. The keys and values inside this dictionary will be written to `/etc/salt/master.d/blahblah.conf` as yaml.
  - `otherthing.conf` *(dictionary)*: same as above. The keys and values inside this dictionary will be written to `/etc/salt/master.d/otherthing.conf` as yaml.

  Here's an example for the `/etc/salt/master.d/` key:

  ```JSON
  {
    "/etc/salt/master.d/": {
      "main.conf": {
        "id": "gcpitsrvsaltmaster",
        "timeout": 12
      },
      "autosign.conf": {
        "autosign_file": "/etc/salt/autosign.conf"
      },
      "fileserver.conf": {
        "fileserver_backend": [
          "gitfs"
        ],
        "gitfs_remotes": [
          {
            "https://sourcecontrol.org.com/salt-repo.git" : [
              { "base": "dev" }
            ]
          },
          {
            "https://sourcecontrol.org.com/salt-repo2.git" : [
              {"base": "develop"},
              {"mountpoint": "salt://salt-repo2"}
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "ext_pillar.conf": {
        "ext_pillar": [
          {
            "git": [
              {
                "dev https://sourcecontrol.org.com/salt-pillar.git": [
                  { "env": "base" }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
